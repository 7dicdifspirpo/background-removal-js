- No need for YouTube Fixes: ZiPhone enables YouTube access on unlocked iPhones without requiring any additional patches or fixes[^2^]
- Embedded apps installer: ZiPhone installs the open source Installer.app v3.13 beta as part of the jailbreaking process, which allows users to download and install various unofficial applications on their iPhones[^3^]
- Customized plugins: ZiPhone allows users to create and use their own plugins for unlocking and jailbreaking their iPhones[^3^]
- Net energy gain: ZiPhone is fast and efficient, taking only a few minutes to complete the unlocking and jailbreaking process[^3^]

ZiPhone can be downloaded for free from this [download page](https://github.com/Zibri/ZiPhone). It is available in both Mac and Windows versions. Users need to connect their iPhones to their computers via USB and run the ZiPhone program. They can then choose from various options, such as "Do it all" (which unlocks and jailbreaks the iPhone), "Jailbreak" (which only jailbreaks the iPhone), or "Unlock" (which only unlocks the iPhone). Users can also select advanced options, such as "Activate" (which activates the iPhone without iTunes), "Debug boot" (which enables verbose boot mode), or "Baseband downgrade" (which downgrades the baseband firmware to an older version that can be unlocked).
 
ZiPhone is a popular and reliable tool for unlocking and jailbreaking iPhones, but it is not without risks. Users should be aware that using ZiPhone may void their warranty, damage their device, or expose them to security threats. Users should also backup their data before using ZiPhone, as it may erase or corrupt some files. Users should also follow the instructions carefully and not interrupt the process once it has started.
 
ZiPhone is a tool for iPhone enthusiasts who want to customize their devices and access more features and applications. It is not recommended for novice users or those who are satisfied with the official Apple software and services.
