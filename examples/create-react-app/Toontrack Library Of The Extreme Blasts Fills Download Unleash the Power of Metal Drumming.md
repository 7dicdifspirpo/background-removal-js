## Metal Drumming Tips and Techniques
 
Toontrack Library of the Extreme â Blasts & Fills will provide you with a lot of inspiration and material for your metal drumming. However, you should also practice some basic tips and techniques that will help you sound more professional and confident as a metal drummer. Here are some of them:

- Tuning: Metal drums should be tuned to a medium-low pitch, with some wrinkles on the floor toms and bass drums. This will give them a deep and punchy sound that cuts through the mix. You should also tune your snare drum high enough to get a crisp and powerful sound, but not too high that it sounds thin or choked.
- Rimshots: Rimshots are when you hit the snare drum with both the head and the rim at the same time. This produces a loud and sharp sound that is perfect for metal drumming. You should practice rimshots on every snare hit to get a consistent and aggressive tone.
- Hi-hats and X-hats: Hi-hats are essential for keeping time and adding groove to your metal drumming. You should use them in different ways depending on the song and the mood. For example, you can play them open or closed, tight or loose, on or off beat, with accents or ghost notes. X-hats are when you mount two cymbals on a stand without a pedal. They produce a short and dry sound that is great for adding accents or syncopation to your metal drumming.
- Cymbal Choke: Cymbal choke is when you grab a cymbal with your hand after hitting it to stop its sound abruptly. This creates a dramatic effect that is often used in metal drumming. You can use cymbal chokes on crashes, rides, splashes, or chinas to add contrast or emphasis to your drum parts.
- Riding the Crash Cymbal: Riding the crash cymbal is when you play continuous notes on it instead of using it as an accent. This creates a loud and energetic sound that is common in metal drumming. You can ride the crash cymbal on different parts of the song, such as choruses, bridges, or solos.
- Get Your Feet Moving: Metal drumming requires a lot of footwork, especially if you use double bass pedals or two bass drums. You should practice your foot technique regularly to improve your speed, control, endurance, and coordination. You should also work on different patterns and combinations between your feet and hands.
- Kick the Bass with The Perfect Pedal: The bass drum is one of the most important elements of metal drumming. It provides the foundation and power for your 8cf37b1e13
