# SolarWinds Network Topology Mapper Keygen: How to Get It and Why You Need It
  
If you are looking for a tool that can help you map your network devices, discover their connections, and generate detailed reports, then you might want to check out SolarWinds Network Topology Mapper (NTM). This software can scan your network and create a comprehensive map of your network topology, showing you the physical and logical relationships between your devices. You can also customize your map with icons, labels, annotations, and filters to suit your needs.

However, SolarWinds NTM is not a free tool. You need to purchase a license to use it for more than 14 days. The price of a license depends on the number of devices you want to scan and the features you want to use. A single license can cost anywhere from $1,495 to $4,995.
  
That's why some people might be tempted to look for a SolarWinds Network Topology Mapper keygen online. A keygen is a program that can generate a valid license key for a software without paying for it. By using a keygen, you can bypass the activation process and use the software for free.
  
## How to Get SolarWinds Network Topology Mapper Keygen
  
There are many websites that claim to offer SolarWinds Network Topology Mapper keygen downloads. However, most of them are either fake or malicious. They might ask you to fill out surveys, download other programs, or enter your personal information before giving you the keygen. Some of them might even infect your computer with viruses, malware, or ransomware.

The only way to get a legitimate SolarWinds Network Topology Mapper keygen is to contact the developers of the software directly and request one. However, this is very unlikely to happen, as they have no incentive to give away their product for free. They might also report you for piracy and take legal action against you.
  
## Why You Need SolarWinds Network Topology Mapper Keygen
  
You might think that using a SolarWinds Network Topology Mapper keygen is a good way to save money and get access to a powerful network mapping tool. However, this is not true. There are many risks and disadvantages associated with using a keygen.
  
First of all, using a keygen is illegal and unethical. You are violating the terms and conditions of the software and stealing from the developers who worked hard to create it. You are also depriving yourself of the benefits of having a legitimate license, such as technical support, updates, and upgrades.
  
Secondly, using a keygen is unsafe and unreliable. You never know what kind of malware or spyware might be hidden in the keygen file or the software itself. You might compromise your network security and expose your data to hackers or cybercriminals. You might also experience errors, crashes, or performance issues with the software.
  
Thirdly, using a keygen is unnecessary and wasteful. There are many alternatives to SolarWinds Network Topology Mapper that are free or affordable. For example, you can use Nmap, Spiceworks Network Map, NetBrain, or PRTG Network Monitor. These tools can also help you scan your network and create topology maps with various features and functionalities.
  
## Conclusion
  
SolarWinds Network Topology Mapper is a great tool for network mapping and discovery. However, it is not worth using a keygen to get it for free. You will only end up breaking the law, risking your security, and missing out on better options.
  
If you want to use SolarWinds NTM legally and safely, you should buy a license from the official website or look for a discount or coupon code online. Alternatively, you can try one of the free or cheaper alternatives that we mentioned above.
