One of the main features of Dune is its oscillator section, which can stack up to 32 oscillators per voice, resulting in a maximum of 8320 oscillators in full polyphony. This allows for rich and complex sounds with minimal CPU usage. Dune also supports VA, Wavetable and FM synthesis modes, giving you more flexibility and variety in sound design.
 
Dune also has a powerful filter section, with zero-delay feedback filters that emulate the characteristics of analog circuits. You can choose from various filter types, such as low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, notch and comb. Additionally, you can use the insert effect slot to add more color and character to your sound, with effects such as distortion, phaser, chorus and flanger.
 
Dune also comes with four graphical envelopes (MSEG), which can modulate any parameter of the synthesizer or the effects. You can draw your own envelope shapes or use one of the presets. The modulation matrix lets you assign any source to any destination, creating complex modulation routings with ease.
 
Dune also has an innovative arpeggiator, which can import MIDI files and play them back with various options. You can adjust the speed, direction, octave range and groove of the arpeggio, as well as apply swing and shuffle. The arpeggiator can also generate random patterns or sequences based on a scale and a chord.
 
Dune also features two master effects buses, each with nine high-quality effects. You can choose from reverb, delay, chorus, flanger, phaser, rotary speaker, compressor, EQ and trance gate. You can also adjust the dry/wet mix and the output level of each bus.
 
Dune is compatible with both PC (x86 and x64) and Mac (AU and VST) platforms. It comes with over 500 presets created by professional sound designers, covering a wide range of genres and styles. You can also create your own presets and save them in the user bank.

- One of the first things you should do is explore the presets that come with Dune. There are over 500 presets in various categories, such as bass, lead, pad, pluck, sequence and more. You can use the browser on the left side of the interface to navigate through the presets and load them by clicking on them. You can also use the arrows on the top right corner to switch between presets. You can learn a lot from studying how the presets are made and tweaking them to your liking.
- Another thing you should do is experiment with the different synthesis modes that Dune offers. You can switch between VA, Wavetable and FM modes by clicking on the buttons on the top left corner of the interface. Each mode has its own advantages and disadvantages, and can produce different types of sounds. For example, VA mode is good for creating analog-style sounds with warm filters and smooth envelopes. Wavetable mode is good for creating digital-style sounds with complex waveforms and morphing capabilities. FM mode is good for creating metallic and bell-like sounds with frequency modulation and feedback.
- A third thing you should do is use the modulation matrix to add movement and expression to your sounds. The modulation matrix is located at the bottom right corner of the interface, and it allows you to assign any source to any destination with a certain amount of depth. For example, you can assign an LFO to modulate the filter cutoff, or an envelope to modulate the oscillator pitch. You can also use MIDI sources, such as velocity, aftertouch or mod wheel, to control various parameters of Dune. The modulation matrix is very flexible and powerful, and it can make your sounds more dynamic and interesting.

These are just some of the ways you can use Synapse Audio Dune VSTi AU 1.3.1 to create amazing sounds. Of course, there are many more features and functions that you can explore and use in Dune, such as the effects section, the arpeggiator, the wavetable editor and more. The best way to learn is by doing, so don't be afraid to experiment and have fun with Dune!
