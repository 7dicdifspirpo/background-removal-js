The album continues Maire's exploration of Celtic music and culture, but also incorporates elements of rock, jazz, and world music. Some of the highlights include "The Big Rock", a lively song about the Giant's Causeway; "Dream On", a romantic duet with Paul Young; and "Heroes", a tribute to the Irish heroes who fought for freedom.
 
The album received positive reviews and was praised for its diversity and creativity. It also reached number 6 on the UK Indie Chart and number 21 on the Billboard World Music Chart[^1^].
  
## 1994: Perfect Time
 
Maire Brennan's third solo album was released in 1994 under the title Perfect Time. The album features 10 tracks, mostly written by Maire or co-written with Tim Jarvis or Ross Cullum. The album marks a shift in Maire's musical direction, as she embraces more of a Christian faith-based approach to her lyrics and themes. The album also features more orchestral arrangements and guest musicians, such as Davy Spillane on uilleann pipes and Nigel Kennedy on violin. Some of the highlights include "Perfect Time", a powerful song about God's timing; "Where I Stand", a personal testimony of faith; and "Heal This Land", a prayer for peace and reconciliation.
 
The album received mixed reviews, as some critics felt that Maire had lost some of her originality and edge.

It also reached number 12 on the UK Indie Chart and number 13 on the Billboard World Music Chart[^1^].
