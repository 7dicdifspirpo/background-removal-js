Rufus is known for its speed and simplicity.

It also supports a wide range of ISO files, including non-ISO9660 compliant ones like openSUSE Leap.

If you need a fast and easy way to create bootable USB drives, give Rufus a try and see how it works for you.
  
Bootable USB drives are useful for various purposes. You can use them to install a new operating system on your computer without using a CD or DVD. You can also use them to test or run a different operating system without affecting your existing one. For example, you can try Linux on your Windows PC by booting from a USB drive. You can also use them to troubleshoot or repair your computer if it fails to boot normally. For example, you can use a Windows recovery USB drive to fix common problems or restore your system.
 
Rufus is not the only software that can create bootable USB drives. There are many other alternatives that offer similar or different features. Some of them are UNetbootin, Universal USB Installer, Windows 7 USB download tool, WiNToBootic, YUMI, Etcher, BalenaEtcher, Ventoy, and Win32 Disk Imager. Each of them has its own advantages and disadvantages, and you may prefer one over another depending on your needs and preferences.
 
However, Rufus stands out for its speed, simplicity, and compatibility. It has a minimal and intuitive interface that lets you create bootable USB drives in a few clicks. It supports a large number of ISO files and formats, including UEFI and GPT. It also has some advanced options that let you customize your USB drive, such as partition scheme, file system, cluster size, label, and more. Rufus is also regularly updated and maintained by its developer, Pete Batard.
