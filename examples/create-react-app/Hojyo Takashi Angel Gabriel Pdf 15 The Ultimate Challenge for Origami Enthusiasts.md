## The History of Hojyo Takashi's Angel Gabriel
 
Hojyo Takashi was born in 1968 in Tokyo, Japan. He started folding origami at the age of four, and soon became fascinated by the art of creating lifelike figures from paper. He studied mathematics and physics at the University of Tokyo, and applied his knowledge of geometry and algebra to origami design. He also learned from other origami masters, such as Akira Yoshizawa, Robert Lang, and Satoshi Kamiya.
 
One of his most famous creations is the angel Gabriel, which he first designed in 1995. The angel Gabriel is a biblical figure who is often depicted as a messenger of God. Hojyo Takashi wanted to capture the grace and beauty of this celestial being in origami form. He used a technique called box-pleating, which involves dividing the paper into a grid of squares and folding along the creases to create complex shapes. He also used wet-folding, which involves moistening the paper to make it more flexible and sculptural.
 
Hojyo Takashi has made several versions of the angel Gabriel, each with different levels of difficulty and detail. The simplest one is a 15-step model that can be folded from a 15 cm x 15 cm square of paper. The most complex one is a 275-step model that requires a 60 cm x 60 cm square of paper. He has also created other types of angels, such as archangels, cherubs, and seraphs.

To fold Hojyo Takashi's angel Gabriel, you need to follow some basic steps:
 
- Start with a square sheet of paper that is white on one side and colored on the other. The white side will be the front of the model.
- Make a diagonal crease on the paper by folding it in half along one diagonal. Unfold it and repeat on the other diagonal. You should have an X-shaped crease on the paper.
- Make a horizontal crease on the paper by folding it in half from left to right. Unfold it and repeat from top to bottom. You should have a cross-shaped crease on the paper.
- Make four more creases on the paper by folding each corner to the center point where the creases intersect. Unfold them and you should have a 4x4 grid of squares on the paper.
- Make eight more creases on the paper by folding each edge to the nearest crease line. Unfold them and you should have an 8x8 grid of squares on the paper.
- Make sixteen more creases on the paper by folding each edge to the nearest crease line again. Unfold them and you should have a 16x16 grid of squares on the paper.
