# Dynamic Bone v1.1.7: A Unity Asset for Realistic Physics Simulation
 
Dynamic Bone v1.1.7 is a paid asset for Unity that allows you to apply physics to your character's bones or joints. With simple setup, you can make your character's hair, cloth, breasts or any part move realistically. It works with Mecanim and legacy animation, supports all versions of Unity from Unity 4 to Unity 2019, and is mobile friendly. It also includes full source code for customization.

If you are looking for a way to add more life and realism to your characters, Dynamic Bone v1.1.7 is a great option. You can download it from the official Unity Asset Store or from some free asset websites[^1^] [^2^]. However, be careful of downloading from untrusted sources as they may contain viruses or malware.
 
Dynamic Bone v1.1.7 is easy to use and has many features. You can adjust the parameters such as stiffness, damping, elasticity, inertia and gravity to achieve different effects. You can also use colliders to prevent the bones from penetrating other objects. You can apply Dynamic Bone to any skinned mesh renderer or transform in your scene.
 
Some examples of using Dynamic Bone v1.1.7 are:
 
- Creating realistic hair and ponytails that sway with the head movement.
- Creating dynamic cloth and skirts that react to wind and body movement.
- Creating bouncing breasts and buttocks that jiggle with the character's motion.
- Creating floppy ears and tails that follow the character's direction.
- Creating ragdoll effects for dead or unconscious characters.

If you want to see Dynamic Bone v1.1.7 in action, you can check out the web demo[^1^] or watch the video[^1^]. You can also visit the forum thread[^1^] to ask questions or share your feedback with the developer.
