Here are some tips and tricks for using Easy Green Screen Pro 3.55 Serial for better photo editing:

- Use a good quality green screen background that is evenly lit and wrinkle-free. This will make your extraction easier and more accurate.
- Use a tripod and a remote shutter release to avoid camera shake and motion blur.
- Use a lens with a low aperture (f/2.8 or lower) to create a shallow depth of field and blur out the green screen background.
- Use a high shutter speed (1/125 or higher) to freeze any movement of your subject.
- Use a flash or a reflector to fill in any shadows on your subject.
- Use a color chart or a gray card to set your white balance and exposure correctly.
- Use a hair light or a rim light to create separation between your subject and the background.
- Use a dual mask processing option for subjects with complex hair or fur. Just make a quick selection around the hair before running EZ Green Screen. The software will treat this area differently than the rest of the image.
