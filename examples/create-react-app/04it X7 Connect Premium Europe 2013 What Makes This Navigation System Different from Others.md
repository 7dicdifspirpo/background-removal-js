To update your navigation system with this map, you will need a DVD+R DL disc with a capacity of 8.5 GB and a DVD burner. You can download the map file from the link below[^3^] [^4^] and burn it to the disc using a software like ImgBurn. Make sure you select the lowest possible burning speed and verify the disc after burning. You can also use a 'Back up' disc facility using high quality media if you are the owner of the original and require this as a 'spare'[^2^].
 
Once you have the disc ready, you can insert it into your navigation system and follow the on-screen instructions to install the map. The installation process may take up to an hour depending on your system. Do not turn off your car or eject the disc during the installation. After the installation is complete, you can enjoy your new map of Europe on your Nissan navigation system.
