# How to Calibrate Your Camera Autofocus with Reikan FoCal
 
If you want to get the best performance out of your camera and lenses, you need to make sure that your autofocus system is accurate and consistent. Autofocus calibration is a process that adjusts the focus point of your lens to match the camera sensor. This can improve the sharpness and detail of your images, especially when shooting at wide apertures or with long focal lengths.

However, autofocus calibration can be tedious and time-consuming if you do it manually. You need to set up a target, take multiple shots at different focus adjustments, compare the results on your computer, and repeat until you find the optimal value. This can take hours for each lens, and you may need to do it again if you change your camera body or firmware.
 
Fortunately, there is a software tool that can automate and simplify this process for you: Reikan FoCal. Reikan FoCal is a software tool that takes control of your camera and calibrates your autofocus with minimal interaction from you[^1^]. It works with most modern Canon and Nikon DSLR cameras and lenses[^6^], and it runs on Windows and macOS computers.
 
Reikan FoCal guides you through the setup and calibration process step by step. It connects to your camera via a USB cable (supplied with cameras) and operates it remotely. It configures, adjusts, shoots and analyses test images automatically. It uses proprietary image processing and predictive statistical algorithms to calculate the best autofocus calibration value for your lens. It also checks your camera position, the lighting conditions and other factors to ensure accurate results.
 
Reikan FoCal can calibrate your autofocus in as little as 90 seconds per lens[^1^]. It also provides many other features and tests that can help you analyse and improve your camera performance, such as Aperture Sharpness, Autofocus Consistency, MultiPoint Focus, Dust Analysis and more[^5^]. You can also generate detailed PDF reports with all the analysis results, compare your results with thousands of other users, and review your test history[^5^].
 
Reikan FoCal is available in two versions: FoCal Plus and FoCal Pro[^1^]. FoCal Plus offers basic calibration and analysis features, while FoCal Pro offers more advanced features and tests. You can buy FoCal Pro from the official website of Reikan[^5^] or from authorized resellers. The price of FoCal Pro is $134.95 USD (as of April 2023), which includes 12 months of updates[^5^]. You can also buy a commercial license or a club license if you want to use FoCal for business or educational purposes[^5^].
 
Downloading a cracked version of FoCal Pro is not only illegal, but also risky, as it may contain malware or viruses that can harm your computer or camera. Moreover, you will not get any updates or support from Reikan if you use a cracked version. Therefore, we strongly recommend that you buy FoCal Pro from the official website or from authorized resellers.
