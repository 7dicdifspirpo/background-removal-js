Manish Soni was born and raised in Ahmedabad, Gujarat. He developed an interest in computers and programming at a young age. He pursued his bachelor's degree in computer science from Gujarat University and then moved to Bangalore to work for a multinational company. He always had a passion for writing and reading Gujarati literature, but he felt that there was a lack of resources and tools to learn and practice the language online. He decided to create his own product that would fill this gap and also promote the rich culture and heritage of Gujarat.
 
He started working on Sulekh Gujarati Softwarebooksks in 2020 as a side project. He spent his weekends and evenings developing the software application and writing the book. He also collaborated with a local manufacturer to design and produce the keyboard. He launched his product in 2022 on his website www.sulekhgujarati.com. He received positive feedback and appreciation from his customers, who found his product useful and innovative. He also received recognition from various media outlets and organizations for his contribution to the preservation and promotion of the Gujarati language.

Manish Soni hopes to reach more people with his product and inspire them to learn and enjoy the Gujarati language. He also plans to create more softwarebooksks for other Indian languages in the future. He believes that technology can be a powerful tool to bridge the gap between languages and cultures.
  
One of the challenges that Manish Soni faced while creating Sulekh Gujarati Softwarebooksks was to make the software application compatible with different devices and platforms. He had to ensure that the software could run smoothly on Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, and iOS. He also had to make sure that the software could support different fonts and formats of Gujarati text. He used various tools and frameworks such as Java, Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to develop the software application. He also tested the software extensively to fix any bugs and errors.
 
Another challenge that he faced was to write the book in a simple and engaging way. He wanted to create a book that would appeal to both beginners and advanced learners of Gujarati. He chose stories and poems from various genres and authors such as Narsinh Mehta, Umashankar Joshi, Pannalal Patel, and Jhaverchand Meghani. He also added his own original stories and poems to the book. He wrote the book in a conversational style and used illustrations and examples to explain the concepts and vocabulary. He also added exercises and quizzes at the end of each chapter to help users practice their skills.
 
Manish Soni is proud of his product and hopes that it will help more people to learn and appreciate the Gujarati language. He says that Sulekh Gujarati Softwarebooksks is not just a product, but a passion project that reflects his love for his mother tongue. He invites everyone to visit his website www.sulekhgujarati.com and try his product for themselves.
