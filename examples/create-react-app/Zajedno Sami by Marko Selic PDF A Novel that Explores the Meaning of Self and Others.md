The novel also contains some memorable quotes that reflect the author's views on life, love, society and art. Some of the quotes are: \"Ta i ta devojka, recimo, kao i svi drugi, ima svog idealnog muÅ¡karca; samo, nevolja je ta Å¡to ona Å¾ivi u Rumuniji, a on je Eskim. Koje su Å¡anse da se sretnu? A znali bi, sve bi im bilo jasno kad bi se samo sreli...ali se naprosto neÄe sresti. Njihovi Å¾ivoti postaÄe ljubavno promaÅ¡eni.\" (That girl, for example, like everyone else, has her ideal man; only, the trouble is that she lives in Romania, and he is an Eskimo. What are the chances that they will meet? And they would know, everything would be clear to them if they just met...but they simply won't meet. Their lives will become love failures.)[^1^]
 
\"Ljudi su kao kockice Rubikove stolice: svako ima svoju kombinaciju boja i oblika koja ga Äini jedinstvenim i neponovljivim. Ali svi smo mi deo iste slagalice koja se zove Å¾ivot. I samo zajedno moÅ¾emo da stvorimo savrÅ¡enu sliku.\" (People are like Rubik's chair cubes: everyone has their own combination of colors and shapes that makes them unique and irreplaceable. But we are all part of the same puzzle called life. And only together can we create a perfect picture.)[^2^]
 
\"Nije bitno Å¡ta radiÅ¡ u Å¾ivotu. Bitno je da voliÅ¡ ono Å¡to radiÅ¡ i da radiÅ¡ ono Å¡to voliÅ¡. To je jedini naÄin da budeÅ¡ sreÄan.\" (It doesn't matter what you do in life. The important thing is to love what you do and to do what you love. That is the only way to be happy.)[^3^]
